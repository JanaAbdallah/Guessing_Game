# Guessing Game

Welcome to the Guessing Game, a simple console-based game written in C. The objective of the game is to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low and keeps track of the number of attempts.

## Features

- Random number generation.
- User input for guesses.
- Feedback on each guess (too high, too low, or correct).

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `guessing_game.c` file.
3. Compile the code using a C compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc guessing_game.c -o guessing_game
   
## Run the compiled program:

./guessing_game

## How to Play

When prompted, enter your guess. The number should be within the specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
The game will indicate if your guess is too high or too low.
Continue guessing until you find the correct number.

Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number within the specified range using the rand() function.
User Input: The user inputs their guess, and the program provides feedback based on the guess.

## Requirements

A C compiler such as GCC.
Basic knowledge of how to compile and run C programs in the terminal.

This project is open-source and free to use. Feel free to modify and distribute the code as you see fit.

Enjoy playing the Guessing Game and happy coding!
